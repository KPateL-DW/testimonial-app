# Testimonial Web App

This project is a React web application that allows users to submit testimonials for a particular client's website. After multiple testimonials are submitted, a simple HTML script tag is provided to the client, which can be added to their website to display all testimonials beautifully. The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling and prebuilt components for testimonials.
